# BME6938 Final Project SVM Activity Classifer

For this read me we are assuming that the user has already extracted the data they want to process for a given subject from the data sets on Figshare from Ingraham et al with the corresponding classification labels in a struct. The file structure that this code assumes is that the data is stored in a struct with each entry corresponding to a subjects and given sensor measurement. Running the first section of this script will create a struct for that subject, which then the user can save in their workspace which takes the raw data and transforms it into the specified features like mean, median and zero crossing. The second section of the scripts loads all the structs for each subject and creates a large matrix and the user can specify the which activities should be included and the number of subjects included in the training and testing set. Then the script with generate a matrix with the feature data corresponding to the training and testing subject selection as well as a matrix with the ground truth activity labels. 

The files extract_time_features.m and extract_frequency_features.m are the functions that take in a matrix of data and output the matrix of selected features. For example, the user specifies if the input data is EMG or IMU data and the output is a matrix corresponding to the time or frequency features we selected such as zero crossing mean and median. 

There are already a couple of preprocessed data files included in the repository. For example, testing_all_filtred.mat, training_all_filtered.mat is training and testing data corresponding the to the feature selection done with the filtered EMG data. If you download SVM_Model.m the code should already be set up to run this data. The other sample data set included is TrainSubject_XY.mat and Test_XY.mat. This data corresponds to unfiltered EMG data for the classes of walking, standing, inclined walking and running. To run the SVM model on this data, the user will need to load the appropriate file in the script and will have to change the training and testing features names to the ones corresponding to the loaded data file. For instance the XTest and YTest would need to be changed to the variable corresponding the the names in Test_XY.mat. The other parameter that a user will need to change depending on the data set is the class_testing variable. The activities that are in data set should correspond to the numbers in the class_testing matrix. 1. Corresponds to standing, 2. Walking, 3. Inclined walking, 4. Running and 5. Cycling. For example, the testing_all_filtered.mat  has standing, walking, inclined walking, running and cycling in it so the class_testing matrix should include 1,2,3,4,5. The only other parameters a user might want to change is if they want to run the hyperparameter optimization. To do this, a user would comment out the current model and uncomment the model labeled as hyperparameter estimation.
